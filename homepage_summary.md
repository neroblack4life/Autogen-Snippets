It's presented as the recommended starting point for building conversational agents and includes installation/usage code snippets. Mentions migration help for users of AutoGen 0.2.
4.  **Core:** An event-driven programming framework designed for building scalable multi-agent AI systems, suitable for complex workflows, research, and distributed applications. Recommended for building workflows or distributed systems.
