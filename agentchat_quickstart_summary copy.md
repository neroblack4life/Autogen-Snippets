Summary of AgentChat Quickstart Page (https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/quickstart.html):

This page provides a quick example of building a single agent application using AgentChat that can use tools.

Key Steps & Concepts:
1.  **Installation:** Reminds users to install necessary packages: `pip install -U "autogen-agentchat" "autogen-ext[openai,azure]"`.
2.  **Model Client:** Shows how to define a model client (using `OpenAIChatCompletionClient` for OpenAI GPT-4o in the example). Mentions that other models/clients implementing the `ChatCompletionClient` interface can be used. Provides links for Azure OpenAI setup and other models.
3.  **Tool Definition:** Demonstrates defining a simple asynchronous Python function (`get_weather`) as a tool for the agent. The example uses a mock weather function.
4.  **Agent Definition:** Shows how to create an `AssistantAgent` instance, providing:
    *   `name`: A name for the agent ("weather_agent").
    *   `model_client`: The previously defined client.
    *   `tools`: A list containing the tool function (`[get_weather]`).
    *   `system_message`: Natural language instructions for the agent.
    *   `reflect_on_tool_use`: Set to `True` for reflection capabilities.
    *   `model_client_stream`: Set to `True` to enable streaming output.
5.  **Running the Agent:** Demonstrates running the agent with a task ("What is the weather in New York?") using `agent.run_stream()` and displaying the output via `Console`. Includes closing the model client connection (`model_client.close()`). Notes that `asyncio.run(main())` is needed if running as a script.
6.  **Example Output:** Shows the expected interaction flow, including the user prompt, the agent's function call, the function execution result, and the final natural language response from the agent.
7.  **Next Steps:** Suggests proceeding to the tutorial for more features after understanding this basic example.
